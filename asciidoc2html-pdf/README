Usage:
------
Running the script generates the following output.

To output the AsciiDoc index.txt as HTML use the following command:
	"./asciidoc2html-pdf.sh html /path/to/report/asciidoc.txt /path/to/output/directory"

To output the index.txt as a PDF use the following command:
	"./asciidoc2html-pdf.sh pdf /path/to/report/asciidoc.txt /path/to/output/directory"

Simply tell the toolchain if you wish to generate a html or pdf report, and the path to the asciidoc
 file of your report, along with the destination directory you wish to generate the report to.

The toolchain should be robust enough to be called from any location, and is hopefully intelligent enough to work out 
out the absolute/relative path issues.

The toolchain will currently generate report output documents as the same name as your input asciidoc file eg:

If you passed "index.txt" as the name of your input asciidoc document, the report will be named index.html, or index.pdf
depending on whether you choose HTML or PDF output.

Dependencies:
-------------
The software has the following dependencies


|=============================
|*utility* | *Description*
|asciidoc | Asciidoc documentation system 8.6.6 Required, copy included in the bin folder
|coverpagehelper.jar | (Required, Local copy in the bin folder.)
|docbook-xsl | Docbook stylesheets (Required, copy is included in the bin folder)
|fop | Apache-Fop 1.0 required (Local copy stored in bin)
|java | Java is required by Apache-Fop, and coverpagehelper.jar
|xsltproc | XML/XSLT processor required (Not included as standard)
|=============================

<<<
Customisation:
--------------

.NOTE:
If you wish to edit the coverpage information which appears in both the PDF and HTML output
simply place the following information at the top of your input asciidoc document. The toolchain
will automatically parse the file and extract the information for use during output document generation.
In later editions, I hope to make it much easier to customise the toolchain to user values.
